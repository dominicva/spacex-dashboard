# SpaceX Dashboard

## What is it?

- A single page web app

## What does it do?

- Reaches out to SpaceX API on page load and populates the company info/overview section at the top of the page with select response data
- Renders two buttons that respectively allow the user to get a summary of the most recent and next upcoming SpaceX launches.
- Summaries includes mission description, embedded youTube video of the launch webcast etc.

## Practice goals

- asynchronous JS
- interacting with an API
- explicit approach to JS' prototypal OOP implementation

## Run on local machine

1. Get the code
2. Run npm install
3. You may need to have parcel installed globally: run npm install -g parcel-bundler
4. Run npm run dev to start dev server

Unfortunately, I am not an employee of, or affiliated with, SpaceX in any way.
